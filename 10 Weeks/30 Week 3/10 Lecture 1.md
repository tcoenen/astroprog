## Basic Python
This week we will treat the basics of Python. We will talk about what makes
a program a Python program, how to run Python code, what the basic data
types are and how to use them. Furthermore we will treat loops and 
`if/elif/else` constructs.

The exercise for this week is about Berkeley Earth data and will teach you
how to read and write simple data files. The exercise can be downloaded
[here](assignment-week-3.pdf) or found in the reader.
